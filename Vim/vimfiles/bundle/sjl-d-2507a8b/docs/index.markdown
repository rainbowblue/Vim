You need to write documentation.  `d` makes it easy:

* Put a bunch of Markdown files in a directory.
* Run `d`.
* Get on with your life.

No fiddling around with configuration files, themes, version numbers,
obtuse markup, or multiple output formats.

Make some Markdown files.  Run `d`.  Move on.

`d` is open source on [BitBucket][] and [GitHub][].  It's MIT/X11 licensed.

<span class="label important">Warning</span> `d` is still fairly new.  It probably
won't eat your data, but I'm not making any promises just yet.
